                    <li>I enjoy working with anything that has to do with numbers and data, but in particular I enjoy optimization, simulation, and applying my math and coding skills to anything I am doing.</li>
                    <li>I have worked on modeling and analyzing raw data from the Large Hadron Collider, numerical simulation of quantum spin chains, Supersymmetry, and have even applied my skills to identify problems in an automotive dealership based on data supported trends. In many of these situations, I have either ended up teaching myself something new to be able to accomplish my goals, or finding unexpected insights or problems along the way.</li>
                    <li>It's safe to say math and coding are passions of mine, and I plan to keep developing my skills as I move through my career, no matter the industry.</li>

                    <li>I am definitely a more quiet person. I enjoy working with a smaller team (10-15 people as an upper bound) as a subset of a larger group. I feel like this leads to better interpersonal relationships which in turn lead to better, more productive problem solving.</li>
                    <li>Outside of work, I also enjoy a wide range of music, from heavy metal, to EDM, to traditional style Chinese and more. I played the trombone for eight years growing up, and my grandfather was in a Beatles cover band, so music is definitely a big part of my life. I also love being out in nature - whether that means hiking, running, fishing with friends, playing backyard sports, or taking the scenic route to appreciate the natural beauty even if it is a little bit slower.</li>

                                I worked as a fundraising agent for Lester Inc. on their specialty team, calling for universities and non-profit groups to solicit donations and service renewals. These donations fell on average in the $100 to $1,000 range. Often times the most successful course of action would be to go off script based on the individual customer and their needs, which allowed me to overcome objections. Outside of my explicit job responsibilities, I would keep track of what works well and what does not and, depending on which account I was working on, advise on customer complaints, and relay this information to my supervisors.

This amounted to keeping track of tens of thousands of dollars in sale orders, and we were able to successfully recover from the incident in a timely fashion. Within one week of systems returning, I had all paper records input into CDK and stored for future reference.

                            <strong>Background:</strong> Part of a two-student team working to build up the theory behind Dr. Agashe's paper
                            <em>arXiv:1209.0772</em> and reproduce the plots to verify the theory and its predictions
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Theory:</strong> Demonstrates that the laboratory frame energy distribution of a daughter particle in a two-body decay contains a peak which corresponds to the energy of the daughter particle in the rest frame of the parent. I found that this peak remains invariant under changes to the parent particle's boost distribution and that this method is model independent, thus it can be useful in analyzing data from the Large Hadron Collider in searching for new physics. This method was later used by the CMS team at LHC to measure the top quark mass.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Simulation:</strong> I made use of MadGraph5 to generate proton-proton collisions which result in the generation of a top and an anti-top quark that further decay into w+ boson and bottom quark, and w- boson and anti-bottom quark. This process was generated for various collider energy levels ranging from 630 GeV to 100 TeV, after which MadAnalysis was used to plot the energy distribution histograms on top of each other. The plots generated were what I expected to see, with a common peak at 68 GeV which was the rest frame energy of the bottom quark that I calculated using the theory.

                            <strong>Overview:</strong> I worked on a research project under the lead of Dr. S. James Gates Jr. on Supersymmetry. The research involved developing a Mathematica package to generate "adinkras" for arbitrary supermultiplets and calculate various combinatorial properties of the resulting graphs. The project lasted over a year.

                            <strong>Overview:</strong> My senior research project at UConn focused on numerically simulating 1D and 2D quantum spin chains, using Python and MATLAB to analyze energy spectra and phase transitions. I refactored legacy code to be modular and scalable, allowing simulations on a wider range of system sizes.
