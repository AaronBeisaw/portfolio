                    <li>I enjoy working with anything that has to do with numbers and data, but in particular I enjoy optimization, simulation, and applying my math and coding skills to anything I am doing.</li>
                    <li>I have worked on modeling and analyzing raw data from the Large Hadron Collider, numerical simulation of quantum spin chains, Supersymmetry, and have even applied my skills to identify problems in an automotive dealership based on data supported trends. In many of these situations, I have either ended up teaching myself something new to be able to accomplish my goals, or finding unexpected insights or problems along the way.</li>
                    <li>It's safe to say math and coding are passions of mine, and I plan to keep developing my skills as I move through my career, no matter the industry.</li>

                    <li>I am definitely a more quiet person. I enjoy working with a smaller team (10-15 people as an upper bound) as a subset of a larger group. I feel like this leads to better interpersonal relationships which in turn lead to better, more productive problem solving.</li>
                    <li>Outside of work, I also enjoy a wide range of music, from heavy metal, to EDM, to traditional style Chinese and more. I played the trombone for eight years growing up, and my grandfather was in a Beatles cover band, so music is definitely a big part of my life. I also love being out in nature - whether that means hiking, running, fishing with friends, playing backyard sports, or taking the scenic route to appreciate the natural beauty even if it is a little bit slower.</li>

In particular, we were able to jump straight into the second phase of the project and begin analysis and simulation of two dimensional systems.</li>

                    <li>I worked as a fundraising agent for Lester Inc. on their specialty team, calling for universities and non-profit groups to solicit donations and service renewals. These donations fell on average in the $100 to $1,000 range. Often times the most successful course of action would be to go off script based on the individual customer and their needs, which allowed me to overcome objections. Outside of my explicit job responsibilities, I would keep track of what works well and what does not and, depending on which account I was working on, advise on customer complaints, and relay this information to my supervisors.</li>

This amounted to keeping track of tens of thousands of dollars in sale orders, and we were able to successfully recover from the incident in a timely fashion. Within one week of systems returning, I had all paper records input into CDK and stored for future reference.</li>
                    <li>I managed General Motors return orders, core claims, and damaged goods claims for the Chevrolet parts department.

            <button class="accordion-button w-full text-left font-semibold">Particle Theory | Advisor: Dr. Kaustubh Agashe, UMD | 02 2021-05 2021</button>
            <div class="accordion-content mt-2">
                <p><strong>Background:</strong> Part of a two-student team working to build up the theory behind Dr. Agashe's paper <em>arXiv:1209.0772</em> and reproduce the plots to verify the theory and its predictions</p>
                <p><strong>Theory:</strong> Demonstrates that the laboratory frame energy distribution of a daughter particle in a two-body decay contains a peak which corresponds to the energy of the daughter particle in the rest frame of the parent. I found that this peak remains invariant under changes to the parent particle's boost distribution and that this method is model independent, thus it can be useful in analyzing data from the Large Hadron Collider in searching for new physics. This method was later used by the CMS team at LHC to measure the top quark mass.</p>
                <p><strong>Simulation:</strong> I made use of MadGraph5 to generate proton-proton collisions which result in the generation of a top and an anti-top quark that further decay into w+ boson and bottom quark, and w- boson and anti-bottom quark. This process was generated for various collider energy levels ranging from 630 GeV to 100 TeV, after which MadAnalysis was used to plot the energy distribution histograms on top of each other. The plots generated were what I expected to see, with a common peak at 68 GeV which was the rest frame energy of the bottom quark that I calculated using the theory.</p>

                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Brown University's Summer Student Theoretical Physics Research Session (SSTPRS) for 2021 took place online through Zoom, with Dr. Konstantinos Koutrolipos and Dr. Kory Stiffler (both from Brown University) alongside Dr. Gates, as well as two student mentors: Aleksander Cianciara (Brown University, PhD Student) and Gabe Yerger (UMD, Undergraduate). Each week covered a different topic:

                </p>
                <p>Each week students worked in groups of three to complete the assigned homework, typically done individually with a discussion before class to come to a consensus on the results. These groups were changed each week so that we ended up working with and communicating with different people throughout the program.</p>

                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I worked on a research project under the lead of Dr. S. James Gates Jr. with a small subset of the SSTPRS group described above. My work on this project was heavily computational; after reading through various relevant papers describing variations of supersymmetric field theories, I used Mathematica and Python to verify the results, create an algorithm to generate explicit matrices from those results, and then mapped the matrices to the fields being described to generate graphical representations of each theory, known as Adinkras. To be sure of the validity of our results, we split the group into several subgroups who worked independently on the same task so that we could come back together and cross examine each other's results to make sure our findings matched and our codes made logical sense.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <li>The goal of this research project was to be able to simulate and understand how one and two dimensional spin chains act under a given hamiltonian, and how they evolve through time. I simulated these systems classically in one dimension using a combination of Mathematica and Python. While the focus of this work was for the 1D case, the 2D case was also studied and I found that the same behaviors arise - bound pairs of quantum spin particles are robust, and do not want to separate under the action of a hamiltonian. In the future, this subject could be studied using alternate algorithms in a quantum computing system, but this was beyond the scope of our project at the time. At the American Physical Society's March Meeting 2024 in Minneapolis, I gave a talk on our findings. </li>
                <li>I also aided Dr. Santos in the onboarding of a new undergraduate student into the project and helped them get caught up on the six months of progress I had made at that point. </li>
